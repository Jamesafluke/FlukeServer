### Zwave Stick Causing Boot Loop Fiasco 11/23/2024
In the morning I updated HA. Fine. Then I added the Google Assistant SDK, and set it up. Then I set up and successfully tested an HA automation that turned on white noise on Mason Mini.
Then I donâ€™t know if I restarted HA or not, but it no device could access HA. 
Found it boot looping. Forums hinted at either corrupted SD card, or a usb stick.
It boots fine when the Zwave stick is out.
